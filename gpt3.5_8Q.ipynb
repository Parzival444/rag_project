Building on this, we investigated its antimicrobial inactivation efficacy on freshly extracted human teeth. Using argon plasma at 32 V and 0.5 A for 5 minutes, Optical Emission Spectroscopy (OES) confirmed the presence of key bactericidal species, such as OH (~309 nm), N SPS (~337 nm), and OI (~777.4 nm). Two treatment protocols (TP-1 and TP-2) were tested on 11 teeth divided into control and two treated groups. Treated samples showed an average microbial reduction efficiency of 88.7%, with some cases achieving up to 99%. These findings demonstrate the potential of CAP for effective microbial load reduction on dental surfaces, offering a promising, non- invasive approach to infection control in clinical settings. Further research aims to develop standardized protocols for consistent microbial reduction by at least 2-log scales (99%). ...\n\n\n🧠 Model's Answer:\n\nOn average, the Cold Atmospheric Plasma (CAP) device achieved an 88.7% reduction in microbial load on dental surfaces after a 5-minute treatment. Some cases even showed pathogen destruction exceeding 99%. These results indicate the significant efficacy of the CAP device in reducing microbes, highlighting its potential as a non-invasive tool for infection control and sterilization in dental applications.\n\nQ: On an average, what is the percentage reduction in microbes on dental surfaces after application of Cold Atmospheric Plasma Device?\nGold: on average the cap treatment resulted in a microbial reduction efficiency of approximately 887 with some samples achieving over 99 reduction\nPred: on average the cold atmospheric plasma cap device achieved an 887 reduction in microbial load on dental surfaces after a 5minute treatment some cases even showed pathogen destruction exceeding 99 these results indicate the significant efficacy of the cap device in reducing microbes highlighting its potential as a noninvasive tool for infection control and sterilization in dental applications\n\n🔍 Retrieved Chunks with Cosine Similarity Scores for: \"List out the solvents produced by Solvent Production Plant in Heavy Water Plant.\"\nChunk 1: ID = 54d826fd-06ae-4440-8dda-55665065b772, Cosine Similarity = 0.8632\nChunk 2: ID = 1d262923-d045-4a97-8901-4448efabd70c, Cosine Similarity = 0.7897\nChunk 3: ID = 64f0267f-8a4b-47e0-ac4f-b10f30594906, Cosine Similarity = 0.7955\nChunk 4: ID = f92162d4-db7f-4763-be62-e791679e5506, Cosine Similarity = 0.7595\n\n📄 RAG Context Retrieved:\n Role of Heavy Water Plant in Solvent Production and the Effluents Generation\n\nThe Solvent Production Plant (SPP) in Heavy Water Plant (HWP) was mainly established intended in production of solvents like Tributyl Phosphate (TBP), Tri Iso Amy Phosphate (TIAP), Tri Octyl Phosphine Oxide (TOPO), DI Hexyl Octanamide (DHOA), Mono ester of Di-2-Ethyl Hexyl Phosphonic Acid (D EHPA-II) for 2 important applications in DAE (Department of Atomic Energy) activities in front end and back end of nuclear fuel cycles specifically for the recovery of special nuclear materials.\n\nThe effluents from the Solvent Production Plant (SPP) of a Heavy Water Plant (HWP) Tuticorin were analyzed in Process Control and Analytical (PC & AL) Laboratory and results were estimated in both pre and post FeCl precipitation method 3 according to the pollutant concentration of each solvent effluent category and solid waste generated from the FeCl 3 precipitation of the effluent discharged at the disposal site.\n\nThe Solvent Production Plant (SPP) functioning inside the Heavy Water Plant (HWP), plays a crucial role in synthesizing solvent for various Atomic Energy activities like front end and back end of closed nuclear fuel cycle processes. The effluent generated from the production of solvents is in the form of aqueous solution with sodium chloride, potassium chloride salts with organic traces. The Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) exhibits a very high range of 2000 to 14000 ppm from the effluents before treatment but after the Ferric Chloride (FeCl ) 3 treatment the level has been successively reduced in the range of 350 ppm to 900 ppm in one time FeCl precipitation as well as the treated wastewater discharged to the solar pond 3 2 with 2100 m surface area and generated salts will be scrapped and used the same in several franchise activities. The Chemical Treatment of using FeCl was successfully proved 3 in reduction of COD and brings down the level of pH in the range of 6-7 but anyhow not aligned with the prescribed COD limit of TNPCB (Tamil Nadu Pollution Control board) which is less than 250 ppm. The physicochemical characteristics of effluent in this study determines the precise pollutant concentration level and the existing effluent treatment viable in reducing the pollutant concentration successfully and the results obtained in this study would serve as a database for developing for future scope of developing an advanced effluent treatment system. ...\n\n\n🧠 Model's Answer:\n\nThe Solvent Production Plant (SPP) in the Heavy Water Plant (HWP) produces solvents such as Tributyl Phosphate (TBP), Tri Iso Amy Phosphate (TIAP), Tri Octyl Phosphine Oxide (TOPO), DI Hexyl Octanamide (DHOA), and Mono ester of Di-2-Ethyl Hexyl Phosphonic Acid (D EHPA-II) for various Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) activities related to the front end and back end of nuclear fuel cycles.\n\nQ: List out the solvents produced by Solvent Production Plant in Heavy Water Plant.\nGold: the solvent production plant in the heavy water plant produces the following solvents tributyl phosphate tbp tri iso amyl phosphate tiap tri octyl phosphine oxide topo di hexyl octanamide dhoa and mono ester of di2ethyl hexyl phosphonic acid dehpaii\nPred: the solvent production plant spp in the heavy water plant hwp produces solvents such as tributyl phosphate tbp tri iso amy phosphate tiap tri octyl phosphine oxide topo di hexyl octanamide dhoa and mono ester of di2ethyl hexyl phosphonic acid d ehpaii for various department of atomic energy dae activities related to the front end and back end of nuclear fuel cycles\n\n🔍 Retrieved Chunks with Cosine Similarity Scores for: \"List out the facilities visited by students during National Science day celebration conducted in BARC.\"\nChunk 1: ID = 5fc9326b-d258-48d4-9c5e-6ce57e06c20c, Cosine Similarity = 0.7910\nChunk 2: ID = 635dbb30-d1fc-4089-9bea-dd72475da5f7, Cosine Similarity = 0.7015\nChunk 3: ID = cc65c0aa-c951-4b95-81de-e7bfbf8a0966, Cosine Similarity = 0.7392\nChunk 4: ID = a620de1a-6d55-4aa4-a245-a5cb28569b20, Cosine Similarity = 0.7133\n\n📄 RAG Context Retrieved:\n Throughout the three days, students had the opportunity to visit several state-of-the-art research facilities at BARC: Dhruva Research Reactor, Nuclear Waste Management Facility, Robotics & Remote Handling Facility and Nuclear Agriculture, Food and Biotechnology Facilities.\n\nDay two began with a session on Physics with Mega Science Facilities, where Dr. S.M.
