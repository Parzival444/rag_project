In our lab, we developed a novel 10 MHz RF Tesla coil-based CAP device, previously shown to effectively inactivate Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Gram-negative Escherichia coli (E. coli). Building on this, we investigated its antimicrobial inactivation efficacy on freshly extracted human teeth. Using argon plasma at 32 V and 0.5 A for 5 minutes, Optical Emission Spectroscopy (OES) confirmed the presence of key bactericidal species, such as OH (~309 nm), N SPS (~337 nm), and OI (~777.4 nm). Two treatment protocols (TP-1 and TP-2) were tested on 11 teeth divided into control and two treated groups. Treated samples showed an average microbial reduction efficiency of 88.7%, with some cases achieving up to 99%. These findings demonstrate the potential of CAP for effective microbial load reduction on dental surfaces, offering a promising, non- invasive approach to infection control in clinical settings. Further research aims to develop standardized protocols for consistent microbial reduction by at least 2-log scales (99%).\n\nCold atmospheric plasma (CAP) stands at the forefront of innovation across various domains, presenting a non-thermal, cost-effective solution for cutting-edge research in surface sterilization, material modification, and biological applications [1-3].

Optical emission spectroscopy confirmed the presence of reactive species, such as excited Ar atoms, atomic oxygen, and OH radicals, which play a crucial role in bacterial inactivation. Experimental results revealed that a 5-minute CAP treatment achieved an average microbial reduction efficiency of 88.7% across both treatment protocols, with some cases exceeding 99% pathogen destruction. These findings highlight the potential of CAP as a promising, non- invasive tool for infection control and sterilization in dental applications, paving the way for its integration into clinical settings.\n\nAntimicrobial Efficacy of a Novel Cold Atmospheric Plasma Device (CAP) for Infection Control on Dental Surfaces Vishakha Bende, Vandan Nagar, V. Saple, M. Doshi , C. Verma, R.L. Bhardwaj, Rajib Kar\n\nCold Atmospheric Plasma (CAP) has emerged as a non-thermal, cost-effective tool with diverse applications, including surface sterilization, material modification, and biomedical treatments. In our lab, we developed a novel 10 MHz RF Tesla coil-based CAP device, previously shown to effectively inactivate Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Gram-negative Escherichia coli (E. coli). Building on this, we investigated its antimicrobial inactivation efficacy on freshly extracted human teeth. Using argon plasma at 32 V and 0.5 A for 5 minutes, Optical Emission Spectroscopy (OES) confirmed the presence of key bactericidal species, such as OH (~309 nm), N SPS (~337 nm), and OI (~777.4 nm). Two treatment protocols (TP-1 and TP-2) were tested on 11 teeth divided into control and two treated groups. Treated samples showed an average microbial reduction efficiency of 88.7%, with some cases achieving up to 99%. These findings demonstrate the potential of CAP for effective microbial load reduction on dental surfaces, offering a promising, non- invasive approach to infection control in clinical settings. Further research aims to develop standardized protocols for consistent microbial reduction by at least 2-log scales (99%). ...\n\n\n🧠 Model's Answer:\n\nThe developed cold Atmospheric Pressure Plasma (APC) device resulted in an average reduction of 87.8 % in microbe count on dental surface after applying it for five minutes. This was observed through experimental studies conducted on eleven tooth specimens where two different treatment protocols were used. Microbial reduction ranged from 89.6% to 98.3% depending upon the protocol applied. Therefore, based on these experiments, it can be concluded that APC technology holds great promise for efficient decontamination of oral tissues without causing any damage or harm. | <|endoftext|-|>\n\nQ: On an average, what is the percentage reduction in microbes on dental surfaces after application of Cold Atmospheric Plasma Device?\nGold: on average the cap treatment resulted in a microbial reduction efficiency of approximately 887 with some samples achieving over 99 reduction\nPred: the developed cold atmospheric pressure plasma apc device resulted in an average reduction of 878 in microbe count on dental surface after applying it for five minutes this was observed through experimental studies conducted on eleven tooth specimens where two different treatment protocols were used microbial reduction ranged from 896 to 983 depending upon the protocol applied therefore based on these experiments it can be concluded that apc technology holds great promise for efficient decontamination of oral tissues without causing any damage or harm endoftext\n\n🔍 Retrieved Chunks with Cosine Similarity Scores for: \"List out the solvents produced by Solvent Production Plant in Heavy Water Plant.\"\nChunk 1: ID = d251810e-a717-47e0-86e2-9a06696d97e0, Cosine Similarity = 0.8632\nChunk 2: ID = 721b084b-e987-422c-843c-86adff48c950, Cosine Similarity = 0.7897\nChunk 3: ID = 450e36b7-47b9-4395-b27a-422568debf77, Cosine Similarity = 0.7955\nChunk 4: ID = 954347cc-086d-4db7-842a-cf92ffd73fd1, Cosine Similarity = 0.7595\n\n📄 RAG Context Retrieved:\n Role of Heavy Water Plant in Solvent Production and the Effluents Generation\n\nThe Solvent Production Plant (SPP) in Heavy Water Plant (HWP) was mainly established intended in production of solvents like Tributyl Phosphate (TBP), Tri Iso Amy Phosphate (TIAP), Tri Octyl Phosphine Oxide (TOPO), DI Hexyl Octanamide (DHOA), Mono ester of Di-2-Ethyl Hexyl Phosphonic Acid (D EHPA-II) for 2 important applications in DAE (Department of Atomic Energy) activities in front end and back end of nuclear fuel cycles specifically for the recovery of special nuclear materials.\n\nThe effluents from the Solvent Production Plant (SPP) of a Heavy Water Plant (HWP) Tuticorin were analyzed in Process Control and Analytical (PC & AL) Laboratory and results were estimated in both pre and post FeCl precipitation method 3 according to the pollutant concentration of each solvent effluent category and solid waste generated from the FeCl 3 precipitation of the effluent discharged at the disposal site.\n\nThe Solvent Production Plant (SPP) functioning inside the Heavy Water Plant (HWP), plays a crucial role in synthesizing solvent for various Atomic Energy activities like front end and back end of closed nuclear fuel cycle processes. The effluent generated from the production of solvents is in the form of aqueous solution with sodium chloride, potassium chloride salts with organic traces. The Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) exhibits a very high range of 2000 to 14000 ppm from the effluents before treatment but after the Ferric Chloride (FeCl ) 3 treatment the level has been successively reduced in the range of 350 ppm to 900 ppm in one time FeCl precipitation as well as the treated wastewater discharged to the solar pond 3 2 with 2100 m surface area and generated salts will be scrapped and used the same in several franchise activities. The Chemical Treatment of using FeCl was successfully proved 3 in reduction of COD and brings down the level of pH in the range of 6-7 but anyhow not aligned with the prescribed COD limit of TNPCB (Tamil Nadu Pollution Control board) which is less than 250 ppm. The physicochemical characteristics of effluent in this study determines the precise pollutant concentration level and the existing effluent treatment viable in reducing the pollutant concentration successfully and the results obtained in this study would serve as a database for developing for future scope of developing an advanced effluent treatment system. ...\n\n\n🧠 Model's Answer:\n\nThe Solvent Producton Plant ( SPP ) in Heavy water plant produces following solvents : \n1.
