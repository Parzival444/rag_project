In our lab, we have indigenously developed a novel 10 MHz RF Tesla coil-based CAP device, specifically for research into biomedical applications. This device has been previously characterized using electrical and optical diagnostics, demonstrating its ability to decimate both Gram-positive S. aureus and Gram-negative E. coli bacteria [4]. Motivated by these findings, we advanced our study to explore the antimicrobial inactivation efficacy of the device on dental surfaces. CAP has shown promise as a non-invasive alternative to conventional dental treatments, particularly advantageous for patients unsuitable for traditional interventions or those with contraindications to specific treatments. Particularly for patients unsuitable for traditional methods [5,6]. However, advancing CAP towards clinical applications requires further preclinical and clinical studies to understand its mechanisms, optimize parameters, and ensure its safety for oral tissues. Current research endeavours prioritize elucidating the ideal parameters and protocols for CAP-based therapies, ensuring their safety profile and exploring their antimicrobial efficacy. In collaboration with the Dental Section of BARC Hospital, we conducted ex-vivo treatments on extracted human teeth to evaluate the antimicrobial efficacy of our device.\n",

Concurrently, another set of four randomly chosen teeth underwent individual treatment with argon cold atmospheric plasma (CAP), facilitated by tweezers. Each extracted tooth was meticulously subjected to cold CAP treatment, held under the CAP source with tweezers, and rotated continuously for a duration of 5 minutes. This rigorous approach ensured that every surface and corner of the tooth received uniform exposure to the CAP treatment, as illustrated. Subsequently, following each treatment session, the treated tooth was transferred into a Falcon tube containing 3 ml of saline solution for further analysis.\n",

Concurrently, another set of four randomly chosen teeth underwent individual treatment with argon cold atmospheric plasma (CAP), facilitated by tweezers. Each extracted tooth was meticulously subjected to cold CAP treatment, held under the CAP source with tweezers, and rotated continuously for a duration of 5 minutes. This rigorous approach ensured that every surface and corner of the tooth received uniform exposure to the CAP treatment, as illustrated. Subsequently, following each treatment session, the treated tooth was transferred into a Falcon tube containing 3 ml of saline solution for further analysis.\n",

      "Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) stands at the forefront of innovation across various domains, presenting a non-thermal, cost-effective solution for cutting-edge research in surface sterilization, material modification, and biological applications [1-3]. In our lab, we have indigenously developed a novel 10 MHz RF Tesla coil-based CAP device, specifically for research into biomedical applications. This device has been previously characterized using electrical and optical diagnostics, demonstrating its ability to decimate both Gram-positive S. aureus and Gram-negative E. coli bacteria [4]. Motivated by these findings, we advanced our study to explore the antimicrobial inactivation efficacy of the device on dental surfaces. CAP has shown promise as a non-invasive alternative to conventional dental treatments, particularly advantageous for patients unsuitable for traditional interventions or those with contraindications to specific treatments. Particularly for patients unsuitable for traditional methods [5,6]. However, advancing CAP towards clinical applications requires further preclinical and clinical studies to understand its mechanisms, optimize parameters, and ensure its safety for oral tissues. Current research endeavours prioritize elucidating the ideal parameters and protocols for CAP-based therapies, ensuring their safety profile and exploring their antimicrobial efficacy. In collaboration with the Dental Section of BARC Hospital, we conducted ex-vivo treatments on extracted human teeth to evaluate the antimicrobial efficacy of our device.\n",
